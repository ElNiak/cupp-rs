# RustCUPP
(Common User Passwords Profiler (CUPP))[https://github.com/Mebus/cupp/]  in Rust. 

The most common form of authentication is the combination of a username and a password or passphrase. If both match values stored within a locally stored table, the user is authenticated for a connection. Password strength is a measure of the difficulty involved in guessing or breaking the password through cryptographic techniques or library-based automated testing of alternate values.

A weak password might be very short or only use alphanumberic characters, making decryption simple. A weak password can also be one that is easily guessed by someone profiling the user, such as a birthday, nickname, address, name of a pet or relative, or a common word such as God, love, money or password.

That is why CUPP was born, and it can be used in situations like legal penetration tests or forensic crime investigations.

It is strange that Rust version is slower than Python version per words:
* Rust:   0,000012109s per word
* Python: 0,000005652s per word

It is also strange that the Rust version produce more words than the Python version.

It is my first Rust program, so it will be fun to analyse !

Probably due to:
* Strings in Python are immutable, and one of benefits of this is they can be cloned by reference. This allows an optimization: if one of strings is empty, then there is no concatenation performed, instead reference to another non-empty string is returned. If you change initial string from "" to something else like "_", then they cannot do this trick anymore and have to do a fair byte-by-byte copy. With this small change python runtime will double and will be about the same as Rust. 
* In Rust this kind of optimizations cannot be implemented in existing push_str because it accepts borrowed string slice and taking reference to it will violate ownership rules. 

## TODO

* [ ] Add tests
* [ ] Optimize code
* [ ] Add CI/CD
* [ ] Add more benchmarks
* [ ] Add more documentation
